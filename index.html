                Welcome to Cobra's Corner, this is where I will show you snipits of what I have accomplished on C# and Unity while attending AIE during my Game Development course.
                This will allow me to complete a Certificate III in Information, Digital Media and Technology.
                I hope you enjoy my website which I wrote in HTML.
            </p>

                Whereas this part is the seperate section usually that has to do with the deading above.
